## Marksite.js for dynamic Markdown docs

<br>

Marksites are websites dynamically-generated based on a single JSON file.
There's no middle layer, backend, compilation or waiting. Your website is instantly ready upon editing.

Marksite webpages come with built-in conversion from Markdown to PDF.
That means your Markdown files automatically become both interactive online and static local documentation.
